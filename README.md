# Pet-Store-Management-System
Web based application system implemented using MERN Stack.

-I set up my development environment by installing the necessary tools and software, including Node.js, NPM, MongoDB, and a code editor of my choice.

-I initialized my project by creating a new project directory and used the "npm init" command to create a "package.json" file.

-I installed the necessary dependencies for my project using NPM, including the MERN stack, Webpack, and any additional Node modules I needed.

-To manage my project dependencies and ensure consistency across different environments, I used Docker to containerize my application and create a Docker image of my project.

-I set up my backend by creating a new Express server, defining my API endpoints, and connecting my server to my MongoDB database.

-I set up my frontend by creating a new React app and using Webpack to bundle and optimize my frontend code.

-I connected my frontend and backend by using HTTP requests to communicate between the two and enable users to interact with my application and manage their pet store data.

-I built out my features by using React to create UI components and Node.js to handle the backend logic, implementing features such as adding and managing pets, tracking inventory, and processing orders.

-To ensure the quality and reliability of my application, I tested it using testing frameworks such as Jest or Mocha to catch any bugs or errors.

-Finally, I deployed my Docker container to a hosting platform such as Heroku or AWS when I was ready to release my application to the public.
